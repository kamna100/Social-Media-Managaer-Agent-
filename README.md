# Social-Media-Managaer-Agent-
Introduction
The Social Media Manager Agent is a beginner-level Python project that simulates the basic functionality of an AI-powered social media assistant.
The agent helps automate content creation and scheduling by generating captions and hashtags based on a user-provided topic and storing them for future use.
This project demonstrates the core concept of AI agents using simple rule-based logic and modular programming.

Objectives

To automate social media content generation
To generate captions and hashtags for posts
To simulate post scheduling using file storage
To understand agent-based system workflow
To practice modular programming in Python

 Agent Working Principle
The agent follows a simple AI workflow:
Input – User provides a post topic
Processing – Caption and hashtags are generated
Action – Generated content is saved
Memory – Stored posts act as agent memory
This mirrors how real AI agents operate in practical systems.
